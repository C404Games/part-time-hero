PRE: After hearing the shout of Tario, the bartender.
PRE: Our hero and Karmelin run to help him.
-Tario: ¡Mamma mía! This's horrible.
-Kamerlín: What's happen, Tario?
-Tario: Oh! Kamerlín, I'm glad to see you. Something horrible has happened.
:It's worse than when I confused the mushrooms and poisoned half the inhabitants of Questville.
-Kamerlín: Calm down Tario! Now, tell me what happened.
-Tario: ...
:In the neighboring town they have opened a new tavern and all my customers were gone.
:If this continues, I will have to close and people will definitely leave Recadelia..
-Kamerlín: We can not afford that.
-Tario: What can we do?
-Kamerlín: It's your turn.
:As I mentioned before, in order to become the greatest hero you need to prove your WORTH.
:Worth to do tasks for others.
:Your duty as hero is to help the villagers with their problems. Your first mission is to help Tario.
-Tario: We're counting on you.
