PRE: After bringing back Tario's clientele, our hero prepares to rest.
PRE: Next day, he received a message from Kamerlin.
PRE: "I'm waiting for you at the smithy." 
-Kamerlín: Thank the Gods you came! This is Rhiron, Questville's blacksmith.
:The weapons of the great heroes were forged in this smithy. He is quite an eminence. 
-Rhiron: ...
-Kamerlín: As you can see, he is not very talkative. Rhiron, don't be shy and tell us what happened.
-Rhiron: ... ...
:... ...
:... ... help.
-Kamerlín: Understood.
:As he has just explained to you, the neighboring town has reviled Rhiron's smithy by saying that all their weapons are fake.
:We can not afford that.
:You must fight alongside Rhiron to prevent the neighboring town from destroying Questville.
:We're counting on you.
Rhiron: ... on you.
